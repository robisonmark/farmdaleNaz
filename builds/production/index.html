In return we want to connect You to God. We are a family and it is our desire to make you part of that family.</p><p>At Farmdale we believe that Jesus is the Son of God and that the Holy Spirit is the third part of the Trinty. We believe the Bible to 100% true. Most importantly we believe that God's love extends to all regardless of backgroud, race, creed or age. Join us to see what it is to be a part of the family of God.</p><br><article class=new><h2>I'm New</h2><p>We know that when you are new you may have some questions below we anwsered some of the most Frequently Asked Questions:<section class=left><h3>What Should I Wear?</h3><p>We want to you to be yourself. I'm sure you have heard it said, "Come just as you are!" Well we embrace that. We want you to feel welcome among us. Some people may choose to wear their "Sunday Best" while others may wear jeans or shorts. The important thing is that you came through the doors.</p><h3>Do You Have Anything for My Kids?</h3><p>Not only do we offer a Nursery for infants but we also have Bibleland during the Sunday School hour. In Bibleland our kids (from ages 3 -11) get to hear a Bible story then the rest of the month that story becomes a part of them through various means like making crafts and learning to cook. We also offer classes for our teens during the Sunday School hour (9:30-10:10). During the worship service our teens stay in the service and get to be a part of the worship. However, after the music, our children (ages 3-7) and pre-teens (8-11) get to be involved in children's church and junior church (respectively); giving them an experience that is more suited toward their attention spans. If you feel more comfortable having your kids in the worship service with you that is just fine. It is always a pleasure to see kids in Service!</p></section><section class=right><h3>What Kind of Worship Style Can I Expect?</h3><p>At Farmdale we want to see generations of God's choosen people worshiping together, therefore we have a blended worship style. We utilize hymns and modern songs to create a worship experience that allows you to connect with God. For us worship is more than just the music we play but about the application, loving God and loving our neighbor.</p><h3>I Noticed You Don't Pass Offering Plates</h3><p>At Farmdale we believe that the giving of tithes and offerings is an act of worship. We believe that this act of worship is between you and God, therefore we have Joy boxes located in the back of the sanctuary. We don't want anyone to feel pressured into putting money "into the plate" because they think that everyone will see that they don't put anything in. We want you to feel like your are giving to God out of love and devotion to him and not out of shame and fear that someone else is watching!</p></section></p></article><p><a class=btn_map href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir//6501+Vandre+Ave,+Louisville,+KY+40228/@38.1354087,-85.646747,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x8869099e71458649:0xc314ea696f3c1486!2m2!1d-85.6421336!2d38.1354004?hl=en">Visit Us</a></p></article></div><div class="scene fullheight" id=events><article class=heading><h1>Events</h1></article><article class=content><p>We are an active community that would love for you to get involved.</p><h2>Section Under Construction</h2></article></div><div id=ministries><div class="scene fullheight"><article class=heading><h1>Get Involved</h1><p>At Farmdale we believe church is about more than just having our needs met.
